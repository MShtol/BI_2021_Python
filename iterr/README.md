# Iterrators and Generators

In this homework you can find some implementation of iterators and generators in python

## Content
1. fasta_reader(path: str) - generator that reads sequences frpm file and returns sequnece and its id one by one
2. class Mutato - class that can itarate over fasta file and return mutated sequences.
3. iter_append(iterable, item) - generator that returns at first iterrates over iterrable and after that returns item
4. nested_list_unpacker(lst: list) - this function can unpack (flatten) lists of any depth. With respect to maximum iteration depth, of course. Returns flattened list
